# CovidCheckin

This is a Covid19 Dashboard iOS app that graphically displays the number of Deaths, Recovered and Confirmed Covid19 cases of over 237 different countries and territories around the world from January 21, 2020 until present day. The intention of the app is to present more day to day covid metrics to the user faster. This is attained using a draggable pan over view that presents the metrics. The API used for Covid data is www.covid19api.com, which is ran an operated by John Hopkins University. This App I wrote was denied from the App store.
